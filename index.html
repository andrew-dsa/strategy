<p>1. Data is the lifeblood of good government, driving informed decision making, beneficial policy and effective public services. Public bodies record, hold and process data continuously to fulfil a wide range of functions and deliver services for people. The public consultation on the National Data Strategy (NDS) describes the untapped potential in the way the government uses data. If government is to realise the many benefits that data can provide, a step change in the way data is used, reused and shared across government is needed. To realise this step change, data in government must be recorded, managed, used and shared in consistent ways.</p>
              
<p>2. Until recently, different parts of government have adopted or created standards for recording, managing, using and sharing data in response to their specific needs and challenges, meaning that core foundational elements are inconsistent and incompatible with data exchange and reuse. There is a need for a centralised and co-ordinated approach to fixing government’s data foundations, as prioritised in the NDS, as one of the 5 key areas of reform.</p>
              
<p>3. Data standards have been identified as fundamental to improving the sharing, integration and uses of data by setting clear and common understandings of how the data is represented, recorded, described, stored, shared and accessed. The government has recognised the need to improve data standards. To drive change and achieve the necessary improvements, a Data Standards Authority (DSA), led by the Cabinet Office in close partnership with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), was established in April 2020. The DSA  sets direction and leads cross-government work on data standards that support the sharing and interoperability of data within government.</p>
              
<p>4. Government operates within a particularly complex context with fiscal, political, technological and operational challenges that need to be carefully factored. The DSA will need to drive a cultural shift in government where data and its usage is viewed as an opportunity to be embraced, rather than threats against which to be guarded. Responses to the NDS and the Civil Service Data Survey 2021 [<a href="https://ma.nttdata.com/civil-service-data-research">https://ma.nttdata.com/civil-service-data-research</a>] signalled that there is widespread support for greater focus on data standards and an authority to drive adoption of standards. As a result a key objective of the DSA is to strengthen existing levers and develop new levers where necessary to drive the adoption of data standards (both incentivisation and controls to compel compliance where appropriate). The DSA will need to work collaboratively with experts from across sectors to make certain that the standards that are proposed and implemented fully meet user needs and are fit for the future and not solely focused on meeting the demands of today.</p> 
          
<p>5. Given the breadth of data aspects that could be standardised and the available resources and capacity, it is essential that the DSA prioritise its efforts in a strategic way.  The DSA works closely with other related areas of work such as the DQHub, Integrated Data Platform, the lighthouse projects, the data sharing playbook, Digital Economy Act data sharing powers, open data and data ethics.</p>
               
<p>6. This strategy sets out the vision and ambition of the Data Standards Authority. It articulates the role of the Authority and its priorities, including key deliverables and the way it will work across government and the public sector to deliver results. The aims and ambitions of the DSA are focussed on material and cultural change in the prioritised foundational data standards. Once in use, these standards support departments and public bodies to drive better outcomes for citizens and improve efficiencies in the delivery of services and in the business of government. A summary of the work of the DSA in its first year can be found in Annex A.</p>
               
               
<h1 id="role">The role of data standards in improving data foundations</h1>

<p>7. Data standards matter. The benefits of a greater standardisation of data across government include:</p>

<ul><li><b>Better public services, decision making and evidence-based policies:</b> Common data standards reduce friction in finding, understanding, sharing, and using (including managing links between datasets and joining datasets together to form new datasets) data.</li></ul>

<p>Chart 4 shows that the provisional non-seasonally adjusted 2021 to 2022 financial year to date total for UK residential transactions (covering April to July 2021) is the highest for this period during the previous 10 financial years, having captured impacts from temporarily increased nil rate bands.</p>

<p>Significant forestalling activity by taxpayers was captured within June 2021 UK residential transactions statistics. Since then, an expected but noticeable decrease has been observed within provisional July 2021 UK residential transactions statistics.</p>

<p>Forestalling is when advanced action is taken to prevent an anticipated event. For these statistics, forestalling refers to taxpayers completing property transactions earlier to take advantage of government housing market policies.</p>



<p>Temporary increases to nil rate bands for UK residential property taxes and the <a href="#Coronavirus-impacts" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a> have both produced significant uncertainties underlying seasonal trends since around April 2020. Seasonally adjusted statistics should therefore be treated with additional caution.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-release">About this release</h2>
<p>These HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) National Statistics provide monthly provisional estimates of residential and non-residential property transactions in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and its constituent countries.</p>

<p>Statistics are based upon records by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.revenue.scot/" class="govuk-link">Revenue Scotland</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority" class="govuk-link">Welsh Revenue Authority (<abbr title="Welsh Revenue Authority">WRA</abbr>)</a> for <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (<abbr title="Land and Buildings Transaction Tax">LBTT</abbr>) and <abbr title="Land Transaction Tax">LTT</abbr> respectively.</p>

<p>The latest release was published 09:30 24 August 2021 and was updated with provisional data from completed transactions during July 2021. The next release will be published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/announcements/monthly-property-transactions-completed-in-the-uk-with-value-of-40000-or-above--82" class="govuk-link">09:30 21 September 2021</a> and will be updated with provisional data from completed transactions during August 2021.</p>

The information can be used as long as the source is clearly described.</p>

<h2 id="Coronavirus-impacts">Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>
<p>During their initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government announced a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> wide lockdown, including restrictions for the property market, from 23 March 2020. During the summer of 2020, restrictions (including those for the property market) were gradually removed.</p>



<p>Public health is the responsibility of devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This has resulted in differences in the management of coronavirus controls within these nations following the first <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> wide lockdown introduced on 23 March 2020.</p>

<p>These differences in national coronavirus controls may affect property transactions patterns within different areas of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Transactions statistics within this release have captured effects from the coronavirus and associated restrictions from around April 2020.</p>

<h2 id="the-latest-statistics">The latest statistics</h2>
<p>The latest statistics section provides <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> residential and non-residential transactions estimates during the previous 3 years. To demonstrate any underlying trends within the data, <a rel="external" href="https://www.census.gov/data/software/x13as.html" class="govuk-link">seasonally adjusted</a> transactions estimates are also provided alongside non-seasonally adjusted transactions estimates.</p>

<p>Caution is advised when interpreting the latest estimates due to their provisional status. Estimates for the latest month are based upon incomplete data as not all <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>, <abbr title="Land and Buildings Transaction Tax">LBTT</abbr> and <abbr title="Land Transaction Tax">LTT</abbr> returns from completed transactions during that month will have been received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, Revenue Scotland and <abbr title="Welsh Revenue Authority">WRA</abbr> respectively when figures are compiled.</p>

<p>We therefore expect statistics to be revised in future months, although transactions figures generally settle after approximately 3 months.</p>
